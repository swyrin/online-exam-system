Our "Principle of Database Management" team assignment, built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!  
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project so you have full control over them.
